## Analysis

Although these deductions are not a thorough analysis of the dataset, the total profit generated is a very small percentage of the total revenue generated and this points to the fact that the business does not seem to be doing so well.
I used the average revenue generated to create a sales band that showed that a higher percentage of the sales made were below the average sales value. This reinforces the earlier deduction that the business is not doing well.
I also observed that the total discount given out was very high and must be a major contributor to the low profit generated.

## Conclusion

The stakeholders of this company need to do further analysis to improve performance as early as possible to avoid further loss.
